# poor-man-s-bookmark

A simple Ruby script to bookmark webpages, with Gtk interface.

Dependencies:
* xclip
* ruby-gtk3
* ruby-gdk3
* ruby-sqlite3
* ruby-nokogiri

Basically, you have a interface Gtk to add/delete/edit bookmarks, grouped by tags. When you click in a bookmark, it will be copied
to you clipboard.

I have just started to wrote this, so it's very dirty and basic at the moment =D
